# SensorServer
To start, go to project folder in your terminal enter:
```sudo npm init```
```sudo npm install```
Install nodemon globally:
```sudo npm install -g nodemon```
I'm assuming that you already have mongodb installed, start mongodb if you don't have it as a service.
At last in your terminal enter:
```nodemon server.js```
Your server will start at 127.0.0.1:5000
To test, install Postman in your Chrome, you can make GET|POST|PUT requisitions.
